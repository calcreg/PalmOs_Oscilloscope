# PalmOs_Oscilloscope
This is a programme to create an oscilloscope with a few components and a palm.
It is needed to send parallele data out of an ADC804 into the palm Rx through a RS232 protocole. Acircuit is given to perform that. Certainly better solution would be done using a simple arduino to send the serial data for display.
